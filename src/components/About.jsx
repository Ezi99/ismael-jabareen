      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm a Computer Science graduate with a passion for creating
        and tackling challenges head-on. I'm a dedicated self-learner who
        constantly explores new technologies and enhances my skillset, whether
        through online courses or hands-on projects. I enjoy solving problems
        independently but also recognize the value of collaboration and know
        when to seek help from colleagues or resources. I'm eager to take my
        first step in the high-tech industry and contribute to meaningful
        projects.
